    "Programming, at it's heart, is about being able to reduce the amount of work it takes to accomplish a task. In manufacturing, this would look like building a machine that can accomplish portions of a task with less human effort. By reducing the amount of work that we have to put into a process, we free ourselves up to focus on the tasks that are not so easily accomplished by anyone besides a competent human being (us). \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a program as really tiny machinery. Your goal is to make a machine (in code) that can accomplish routine tasks for you. When you're done, you get to focus on other important tasks that demand your attention. For example, you might want to spend your time working on a forecast model, but first you need to check to make sure that all values in your time series are valid. You COULD just open up your data, and look at every record to make sure that each fits the rules that valid data should follow. Or you could write a program that can check every line for you, and either alert you to problems, or possibly fix them without you even having to be involved. Then, all of your time is freed for the forecasting model.\n",

    "Just a minute ago, we thought about a problem where we might need to check each record in a data set for valid entries. If we want to accomplish this kind of task, we need to write code that will check the first line, then the second line, then the third line, etc. We can do this by hand, of course. Imagine a list of entries stored in the variable `forecastData`, where we need to make sure that each record is above 40 but below 50. Checking each value manually for validity might look something like the code below:"

    "That is a LOT of redundant code. Does it work? Sure. But what happens when I need to fix it? As I typed those lines, I did some copying and pasting, and then noticed that I made a few typos. At that point, I had to fix the typos and then copy and paste the corrected code again. Not ideal, but functional. Then I did it again!

    "`i` becomes a **placeholder**, or a variable that will be temporarily assigned each time our loop goes to work. It will use each entry in `forecastData` one time, and while a given entry is being used, it will have the nickname `i`. That way, we can write all the code in our loop to describe what should happen to `i`. Then, in each pass of the loop, `i` takes the next value, and we follow the same set of instructions. In this case, we are just checking that our variables meet the established criteria, and then printing `True` if they do, or `False` if they don't.\n",
