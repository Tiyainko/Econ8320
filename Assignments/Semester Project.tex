\noindent The semester project is intended to allow you to practice putting all of the concepts from class to use in a data project of your own choosing. You will be expected to scrape data from a website, clean that data in preparation for analysis, then implement your chosen form of analysis in order to address your proposed research goal. You may choose any research question that interests you, so long as you scrape data from one of the following websites:

\begin{itemize}
\item \url{https://www.sports-reference.com/}
\item \url{https://www.etsy.com/}
\item \url{https://brickset.com/}
\end{itemize}

I anticipate that scraping sports-reference.com will be significantly easier, but want to accomodate the fact that not everyone will be interested in completing a sports-related research project.

\textbf{Steps to Project Completion:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Project Proposal (50 pts)
\begin{itemize}
\item What data source will you use?
\item What question will you attempt to answer?
\item What information do you anticipate will allow you to answer that question?
\end{itemize}
\item The Project (150 pts)
\begin{itemize}
\item Conduct research based on your proposal using the tools covered in this class
\item Write a short summary of your findings (about 3 pages)
\item Discuss tools that we didn't cover that might have been useful in your project
\end{itemize}
\item The Presentation (50 pts)
\begin{itemize}
\item Summarize your results for the class
\item Discuss one or two challenges you encountered, and your solution
\item Presentation should be approximately 5-7 minutes
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What to Turn In:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Project proposal (in Word or PDF format)
\item Code for project implementation (may be in multiple files, but each should be of the .py format)
\item Project write-up (in Word or PDF format)
\item Slides?
\end{enumerate}
