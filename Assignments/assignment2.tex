In order to become more familiar with functions in Python, we will write some functions to solve various problems that will become important as we move further into data analytics. Because most of these operations are pre-packaged in Python, I want to make clear that I expect you to write your OWN functions, not to use the existing functions. Using the pre-built functions will result in lost points. Write functions that can complete the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the largest (or smallest) number in a list of any size
\item Sort a list of numbers
\item Sort a list of words, ignoring upper and lower cases
\item Use the csv module (documentation at \url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#module-csv}) to read a csv file, and store only the row with the largest number in the third column. Be sure to store the entire row, though!
\end{enumerate}
