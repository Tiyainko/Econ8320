# Week 8 - Plotting with the Plotly API

---

### Plotting Options in Python

1. `matplotlib` - The classic library, with options to change just about everything. Creates static images
2. `seaborn` - A stats-focused wrapper for `matplotlib` 
3. `pygal` - For SVG-based graphics, interactive plots
4. `plotly` - Based on D3.js, allows for dynamic plotting and data dashboards hosted online
5. `bokeh` - Also based on D3.js functions
6. `ggplot` - uses the Grammar of Graphics structure to mimic R's ggplot2

### Why Use Plotly?

Plotly is a good choice for several reasons:

- It allows for easy interactive plotting
- Interactive plots can be embedded in notebooks
- Can be run on a server
- Plotly has developed a dashboard API to complement their plotting library
